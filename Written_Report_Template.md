# Kickstarting with Excel
My Analysis on the Kickstarter Data.

## Overview of Project
	The data provided to me in excel spreedsheet, represents a 	raw information of Kickstarter compaigns. 

### Purpose
	To help Louise to simply understand the provided data, and 	giving her elements to make the right desision.
## Analysis and Challenges
	Many Excel functions didn't work well with my until I've 	updated my excel version.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	I can tell that the month s of May and June both have 	greater success rate to launch a compaign, comparing to the 	months of November, December, and January.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Based on the outcomes bases on goals charts, I've noticed 	that the most successful compaigns regarding range dollar 	amount are the ones located in between ($35,000 to $44,999),		this last rane alone have riched about 70% of success. The
	below $4,999 also riched the highst successful percentage 
	rate of 80% 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	I sometimes spent a lot of time in applying excel formulas, 	and I realised how time consuming is the data world.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
	1-Launch more compaigns during the moths of May and June.
	2-don't spend too much energy in compaigning during the 	months of November, December and January. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	1-Focuss the compaign on the range donation located in 	between $34,999 to $44,999, and the ones below $4,999.
	2-The range compaigns located in between $45,000 to $49,999 	were 100% failed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	This data does't offer more information in order to tell 	what are some elements in the compaigns where goals are far 	to achieve, probably this is related to other events, dollar 	rate on the stock, oil crisis...etc

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 
	I would like to add more charts and graphs where I can 	compare the percentage variation in between goal and pledged 	amount by country.
